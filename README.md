Lab Assistant AI for Biology Students

Summary

An AI assistant designed to help biology students in laboratory work by guiding them through protocols, preventing common mistakes, and offering real-time suggestions. Building AI course project.

Background

* Many biology students struggle with complex lab protocols, which can lead to mistakes, wasted materials, or incorrect results.
* Lab safety and efficiency are critical, especially for beginners.
* My motivation: I want to reduce the stress and errors students face in biology labs.
* This project is important because it can make lab work more effective, safe, and educational.

How is it used?

* Students interact with the AI through a computer or mobile device during experiments.
* The AI provides step-by-step guidance, safety warnings, and troubleshooting advice.
* Users: biology students, lab instructors.
* Needs to account for varying experience levels and different lab equipment.

Data sources and AI methods

* Data: Open-access biology protocols, lab manuals, and student feedback.
* AI methods: NLP for understanding instructions and questions, recommendation systems for suggesting next steps, error detection using pattern recognition.
* Optional demo: chatbot interface that answers protocol-related questions.

Challenges

* The AI cannot replace expert supervision.
* Limited to the protocols and datasets it has learned from.
* Ethical consideration: safety—misleading advice could be harmful.

What next?

* Expand AI to cover more biology subfields and lab techniques.
* Integrate with virtual lab simulators for safer practice.
* Collect more student interaction data to improve guidance accuracy.

Acknowledgments

* Inspiration from biology lab manuals and teaching resources.
* Open-source AI tools like HuggingFace Transformers (for NLP) and TensorFlow.
